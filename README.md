# Number-of-steps
Simple python solution for 'Number of steps' problem on HakcerEarth.
To be honest, I didn't at first get the logic of the problem until I read the code of 
Ruturaj Dilip
A user on HackerEarth that shared his code. So I though I'd share my code here as well. 
Although most of the credit goes to Ruturaj
